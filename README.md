Dream Garage is an interactive 3D web experience that brings your fantasy garage to life. Designed as a personal showroom for showcasing an exclusive collection of supercars, this project blends cutting-edge 3D graphics with smooth, cinematic animations.

Powered by Three.js, the showroom features high-fidelity 3D models of iconic supercars, immersive lighting, and realistic reflections to elevate the visual experience. The application is structured using React.js and Next.js, enabling fast rendering, modular architecture, and server-side optimization for performance.

With the power of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), each transition — from camera movement to car interactions — is crafted to feel responsive and fluid, enhancing user engagement. Visitors can freely explore the space, rotate around the cars, view specs, or trigger animations like opening car doors, changing lighting conditions, or switching between vehicles.

Key Features:

🚘 Realistic 3D models of top-tier supercars

🌀 Smooth camera transitions and car animations with GSAP

🌐 Seamless navigation and routing using Next.js

💡 Physically accurate lighting & reflections

📱 Responsive layout, optimized for desktop and tablet

Tech Stack:
