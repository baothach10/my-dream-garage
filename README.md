# My Dream Garage Project

**My Dream Garage** is an interactive 3D web experience that brings your fantasy garage to life. Designed as a personal showroom for showcasing an exclusive collection of supercars, this project blends cutting-edge 3D graphics with smooth, cinematic animations.

Powered by **Three.js**, the showroom features high-fidelity 3D models of iconic supercars, immersive lighting, and realistic reflections to elevate the visual experience. The application is structured using **React.js**, enabling fast rendering and modular architecture.

A dedicated **Web Worker** handles the heavy lifting of resource loading — such as 3D models, HDR environments, and configuration JSON files — in the background. This offloads processing from the main thread, ensuring a buttery-smooth experience even during intensive asset preparation.

With the power of **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**, each transition — from camera movement to car interactions — is crafted to feel responsive and fluid, enhancing user engagement. Visitors can freely explore the space, rotate around the cars, view specs, or trigger animations like opening car doors, changing lighting conditions, or switching between vehicles.
